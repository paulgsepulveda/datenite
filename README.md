# DateNite API

This is the NodeJS API server for the DateNite app.

## How it works:

The app or the site (use VueJS) hit the API with a request:

`Stuff`

Then the API spits out a standard JSON response like so:

`Stuff`

The app/page receives the response and displays accordingly.

## Static Components

* Landing Page - what it does, plans for the future
* About Page - disclosures, contact form
